# NK-JittorCV

This is an organization presented by [Media Computing Lab](https://mmcheng.net/) at Nankai University and maintained by [Qibin Hou](https://houqb.github.io/). The goal is to provide wonderful computer vision projects based on the [Jittor](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/) framework. We have some collaborators to help maintain this organization:

- [Xiang Li](https://implus.github.io/)
- [Deng-Ping Fan](https://dengpingfan.github.io/)
- [Xialei Liu](https://mmcheng.net/xliu/)

At present, we have offered the following four projects. More methods and projects will be added to enrich the jittorcv community.

- [JittorCls](https://github.com/Nankai-JittorCV/jittorcls). An image classification repo.
- [JittorDet](https://github.com/Nankai-JittorCV/jittordet). An object detection repo.
- [JittorSeg](https://github.com/Nankai-JittorCV/jittorseg). A semantic segmentation repo.
- [NK-Diffusion](https://github.com/Nankai-JittorCV/nk-diffusion). A diffusion-based repo for image content generation.
